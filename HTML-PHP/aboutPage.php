                /recipe website name/ is the place where everyone can find the perfect recipe for making an amazing meal. We designed the website with simplicity and feasibility of use, which resulted in a minimalist design focused on showing the recipes themselves.
                We believe that there is a recipe for everyone as well as that not all people are expert cooks or do not spend that much on such activities.
                That is why our main focus was to make a website that will be suitable for both people who want a fast and easy meal as well as those who enjoy cooking and do not mind investing a lot of time and effort into it.

            <p>
                The team behind /recipe website name/ consist of two ICT & Software Engineering students at Fontys Eindhoven - Antonio Takev andDimitar Prisadnikov. For both of us /recipe website name/ is the first website project we have done. Apart from the web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, SQL), we are mainly skilled in working with C#, OOP, Windows forms. Also, we have a basic level of knowledge when it comes to C++, Arduino development,  R, Linux, networking and Adobe XD.
